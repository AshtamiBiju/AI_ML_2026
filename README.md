## About
This repository is my **structured AI/ML learning roadmap** for 2025–2026. It covers:
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Solved in Python, progress tracked daily.
- **AI/ML Tool Practice:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn basics.
- **Kaggle Competitions:** Exploratory notebooks and competition practice.
- **Deployment & MLOps:** Model deployment (Streamlit/Flask), containerization (Docker), CI/CD basics.
- **Open Source Contributions:** Beginner-friendly PRs and fixes in ML/DSA repositories.
- **Certifications:** Industry-recognized certifications in AI/ML.

---

## Kaggle Notebooks
- **Current:** Titanic dataset (added to GitHub)  
- **Future:** MNIST, CIFAR-10, and medium-level Kaggle competitions  

---

## Deployment / MLOps
- Deploy ML models using **Streamlit/Flask**  
- Containerize projects with **Docker**  
- Automate workflows with **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**  

---

## Certifications
- **Planned / In-progress:**  
  - AWS AI Practitioner  
  - DeepLearning.ai – Deep Learning Specialization  
  - TensorFlow Developer Certificate  
  - Google Data Analytics  

---

## Open Source Contributions
- **Target repositories:**  
  - [`TheAlgorithms/Python`](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) → DSA implementations  
  - [`huggingface/transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) → tutorials, notebooks  
  - [`tensorflow/models`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) → small PRs & examples  

---

## Future Work
- Master advanced DSA: Graphs, DP, Tries  
- Participate regularly in Kaggle competitions  
- Contribute to 5–10 open-source repositories before Jan 2026  
- Strengthen deployment & MLOps workflow skills
